        <p>This is a blog for sharing my experience of playing different games. </p>
        <p>I am a person who loves games. I often play video games at home. I like to play NOT only PC, but also PS4 and NSwitch. I play all kinds of games. I play MOBA games, such as DOTA and LOL; I play RPG games, such as FF. I play Action games, such as Monster Hunter World.</p>
        <p>I will share my feelings and experience of playing games here.</p>
